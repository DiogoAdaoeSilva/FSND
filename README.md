# Projects

## 01_fyyur [Passed review]
The goal of the project was to complete the Udacity's starter code, adding the missing models, controllers and completing views.

Fyyur is a CRUD app where the user can list venues, artists and shows. The user can create a new venue, artist or show, view the existing venues, artists and shows, update them and delete them.

The app is built with Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL

#### Learning Highlights:
- How to do a simple CRUD that is connected to a DB 
- Used migrations to update the DB models with Flask db migrate
- Learned about Fetch and the methods POST, GET and DELETE
- Used the Model Controller View pattern to structure my app
- Used the SQLAlchemy query API
- Creating relationships in SQLAlchemy
- Used the WTForms library for form validation and rendering in Python
